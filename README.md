# SkyblockCreation

The download of a small-scale recreation of Hypixel's Skyblock minigame in vanilla datapacks.
An indie-pack developed by Sadan (Master Mode)
## Installation (world)

To fully install the world, follow the steps below.

```hs
Be sure you're on SkyblockCreation-World and not SkyblockCreation-Datapack!

1/ Download the zip
 a) Hit the "Code" dropdown near the top right
 b) Be sure you're on the 'local' tab
 c) Click 'Download Zip' near the bottom of the dropdown

2/ Unzip the file (using something like winrar or 7zip) to get the world file
 a) The file should be called something along the lines of 'SkyblockCreation-World-main' 

3/ Inside of the folder you just opened, there should be yet another folder called 'SkyblockCreation-World-main'.
 a) A bit confusing, but it should be clear
 b) Let's called this folder "WorldMain", and the actual folder you downloaded be called "WorldZip"

4/ Drag WorldMain into your saves folder, which should be located in your .minecraft folder.
 a) This should NOT be WorldZip.

5/ Launch Minecraft and the world should be there.
 a) If the world prompts to make a backup before using experimental features, ignore it.
  i) It always shows up when using certain features, its not experimental
 b) In the world, do /reload to be sure everything loaded properly.
 c) The load messsage should show up!
```
If the world doesn't show up, then it's likely that you've either dragged WorldZip into your saves folder, or something else went wrong. Contact me if this happens
